Final group project for DATA ANALYSIS METHODS or cs105. Done in python through vscode and jupyter notebook. 

The datasets are far too large to be put into github which is why it can't be found in the folder. 


I completed the parts of clustering datahubs across the US both as a whole country and by city using k-means clustering.
As well as added colored city boundaries on the map and did interactive labels for the average rating for each business hub per city. 

The map as a whole is interactive and can zoom in and out.
